    <p>Welcome to the help center. Use the topics below to get answers to common questions.</p>

    <h3>Game vision & fair-play manifesto</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tribe-first:</strong> Built for coordination—shared intel, roles, and ops planning are core.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic clarity:</strong> Clear timers, reports, and filters; no hidden pay-to-win boosts.</li>
        <li><strong>Counterplay everywhere:</strong> Every tactic has an answer (scouts vs fog, walls vs siege, fakes vs filters).</li>
        <li><strong>Fair monetization:</strong> Cosmetics/QoL only; no stat boosts, no power creep.</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery paths:</strong> Protection, hospitals, tribe aid, and comeback tools keep players in the fight.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Rotating world presets (classic, hardcore, fog, seasonal events) keep the meta fresh.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Register an account and create your first village.</li>
        <li>Build resource structures to grow wood, clay, and iron.</li>
        <li>Upgrade your town hall to unlock faster build times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gameplay basics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Recruit units in the barracks, stable, and workshop once unlocked.</li>
        <li>Research upgrades in the smithy and academy to strengthen your army.</li>
        <li>Use the map to scout nearby villages and plan attacks or support.</li>
        <li>Academy research unlocks advanced troops; each research has building level requirements and takes time/resources. Noble research needs minted coins before noblemen can be trained.</li>
    </ul>
