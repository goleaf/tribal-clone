# dev.to article checklist

- Define audience and outcome in the first 3 sentences; state prerequisites and versions.
- Provide repro steps or sample repo; include copy-pastable commands; warn when steps are destructive.
- Link to primary references on devdocs.io for APIs/language features mentioned.
- Add diagrams only if they compress info; otherwise prefer text lists; keep assets lightweight.
- Close with further reading, related posts, and request for feedback; ensure code licenses are compatible.
