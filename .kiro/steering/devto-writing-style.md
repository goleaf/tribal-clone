# dev.to writing style

- Voice: friendly, concise, actionable; prefer short paragraphs and code blocks; lead with context, close with next steps and links.
- Structure: title that states the value, intro that sets scope, numbered sections with headers, TL;DR or key takeaways, and a call to action.
- Code: inline snippets for tiny examples, fenced blocks with language tags for anything longer; avoid dead code and keep runnable where possible.
- Accessibility: add alt text for images, prefer text tables over screenshots, ensure color-agnostic callouts.
- Metadata: include tags (max 4–5) that match the stack; link to canonical docs (devdocs.io) for APIs; avoid clickbait or keyword stuffing.
