# Military Units & Roles

## Overview

This document defines the complete military unit roster for our medieval tribal war browser MMO. The system is designed around strategic depth, clear unit roles, and meaningful counter-play while maintaining accessibility for new players and complexity for veterans.

### Design Philosophy

- **Clear Identity**: Each unit has a distinct battlefield role and visual identity
- **Strategic Depth**: Rock-paper-scissors counters with situational exceptions
- **Progression**: Units unlock through building upgrades and research
- **Specialization**: Villages can focus on specific military roles
- **Balance**: No single unit dominates; all have clear strengths and weaknesses

## Unit Categories

### Infantry
Ground troops forming the backbone of any army. Durable, cost-effective, but slow.

### Ranged
Projectile units dealing damage from distance. Effective against infantry, weak in melee.

### Siege
Specialized units for breaking fortifications. Slow, expensive, devastating against walls.

### Scouts
Fast reconnaissance units for gathering intelligence. Minimal combat power.

### Support
Units providing battlefield advantages through morale, healing, or logistics.

### Elite Units

## Balance Considerations

### Population Management

**Total Population Limits**:
- Early Game: 200-500 population
- Mid Game: 500-2000 population
- Late Game: 2000-5000 population
- End Game: 5000-10000 population

**Army Composition Limits**:
- No more than 50% of army should be one unit type (encourages diversity)
- Elite units limited by special building capacity
- Siege weapons limited by Workshop level
- Support units limited by Temple/Market levels

### Resource Costs

**Cost Scaling**:
- Basic units: Cheap (wood, clay, iron)
- Cavalry: Moderate (more iron, food for horses)
- Elite units: Expensive (all resources + gold)
- Siege: Very expensive (massive wood and iron)
- Support: Moderate (food and gold)

**Training Time Scaling**:
- Basic infantry: 1-5 minutes
- Advanced infantry: 5-15 minutes
- Cavalry: 10-30 minutes
- Elite units: 30-120 minutes
- Siege: 60-240 minutes
- Heroes: 24+ hours

### Counter-Play Depth

**Ensuring No Dominant Strategy**:
- Every unit has clear counters
- Terrain and fortifications matter
- Numbers can overcome quality (to a point)
- Elite units powerful but limited
- Scouting provides strategic advantage
- Timing and coordination crucial

**Preventing Stagnation**:
- Regular balance patches
- Seasonal units shake up meta
- New research unlocks change strategies
- Alliance warfare requires coordination
- Events introduce temporary mechanics

---

## Implementation Notes for Developers

### Database Schema Considerations

**Unit Table Fields**:
- unit_id, unit_name, unit_type, attack, defense, speed
- carrying_capacity, population_cost, training_time
- resource_costs (wood, clay, iron, food, gold)
- building_requirements, research_requirements
- special_abilities, counter_bonuses

**Combat Calculation**:
- Base damage = attacker_attack - defender_defense
- Apply terrain modifiers
- Apply formation bonuses
- Apply counter bonuses (e.g., spears vs cavalry)
- Apply morale effects
- Calculate casualties
- Apply special abilities (Berserker rage, Rune Priest healing)

### UI/UX Recommendations

**Unit Selection Screen**:
- Visual icons for each unit
- Hover tooltips with full stats
- Color-coded by role (red=offense, blue=defense, green=support)
- Show counters and weaknesses clearly
- Training queue visible

**Battle Reports**:
- Show unit-by-unit breakdown
- Highlight key moments (charges, routs, special abilities)
- Visual representation of battle flow
- Casualty breakdown by unit type
- Loot/resource gains

**Army Management**:
- Preset army templates
- Quick-train buttons for common compositions
- Visual army strength indicator
- Travel time calculator
- Supply requirement warnings

### Testing Priorities

1. **Balance Testing**: Ensure no single unit dominates
2. **Counter Mechanics**: Verify all counters work as intended
3. **Progression Pacing**: Unlock timing feels rewarding
4. **Performance**: Large armies don't cause lag
5. **UI Clarity**: New players understand unit roles
6. **Edge Cases**: Unusual army compositions handled correctly

---

## Conclusion

This unit roster provides deep strategic gameplay while remaining accessible to new players. The clear counter system ensures no dominant strategy, while elite units and specialization options reward long-term planning. Seasonal and event units keep the meta fresh, and tribe-specific variants add flavor without breaking balance.

The progression system ensures players always have new goals, from unlocking basic cavalry to earning legendary heroes. Village specialization encourages multiple villages with different roles, promoting strategic empire building.

Most importantly, every unit has a purpose. From the humble Tribesman defending his home to the legendary Warlord leading armies to glory, each unit contributes to the rich tapestry of tribal warfare.
