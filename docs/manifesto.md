# Game Manifesto (Player-Facing)

## What This Game Is
- A persistent, tribe-first medieval war MMO built for timing, planning, and coordination.
- Fair by design: progression comes from smart play and teamwork, not wallet size.
- Varied across worlds: rotating rules (speed, fog, weather, conquest variants) keep the meta fresh.

## Pillars You Can Rely On
- **Tribe-First:** Roles, shared intel/markers, ops planner, and war boards put group play at the center.
- **Strategic Clarity:** Reports and UI surface modifiers (morale, night, terrain, luck); timers and filters help you parse fakes vs real threats.
- **Counterplay Everywhere:** Fakes vs watchtowers, cav vs ranged, pikes vs cav, mantlets vs archers, siege vs walls; no unstoppable tactic.
- **Fair PvP:** No pay-to-win; monetization is cosmetic and convenience with caps. Protection, morale (when enabled), and rate limits curb bullying and spam.
- **Recovery Paths:** Hospitals, tribe aid, shields for newcomers, and rebuild aids mean you can bounce back after losses.
- **Variety & Freshness:** Seasonal events, experimental worlds, and alternate win conditions (relics, wonders, beacons) keep long-term play interesting.

## Our Commitments
- **No Power Sales:** Cosmetics and QoL only; combat power is earned in-game.
- **Transparency:** Publish world presets and rule toggles up front; show modifiers in reports.
- **IP Safety & Originality:** Unique names/terms for units/buildings/mechanics; no legacy tribal-war jargon.
- **Anti-Abuse:** Rate limits on commands/attacks, anti-push rules, sitter/role permissions, and protection rules to keep fights fair.
- **Accessibility:** Readable UI, clear alerts, localization-ready strings, and reduced-motion/high-contrast options.

## How to Win (and Why It’s Fun)
- Coordinate with your tribe to control objectives (relics, wonders, territory) while balancing economy, intel, and timing.
- Outsmart opponents via intel freshness, timing trains, and countering their comps; every move has a response.
- Grow from a single village to a specialized network without grinding walls or wallets.
