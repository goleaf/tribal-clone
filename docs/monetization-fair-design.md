# Monetization Design — Fair-First PvP Medieval Tribal War Browser MMO

## Monetization Goals & Constraints
- Preserve competitive fairness: no direct power sales, no exclusive combat stats, no wallet-gated progression.
- Reward time and skill: all competitive advantages must come from play (strategy, coordination, timing), not spend.
- Respect player agency: transparent value, predictable effects, no loot-box-only core items.
- Low friction on core loop: attacks, defense, scouting, and tribe coordination never require payment.
- Regional compliance: clear pricing, tax-inclusive where required, parental controls and spending caps.
- Longevity: sustainable revenue via cosmetics, convenience with strict caps, and optional subscriptions without pay-to-win.

## Product Types
### Cosmetics (Non-Power, Visual Only)
- **Village Skins:** architectural themes (Frontier Timber, Stonekeep, Desert Outpost, Harbor Hamlet, Highlands Fort, Autumn Harvest). Change building appearance, banners, and terrain dressing.
- **Unit Skins:** visual swaps per archetype (Pikeneer with raven shields, Lancer with barded horses, Siege crews with storm cloaks). Includes matching projectile VFX colorways.
- **Profile & Tribe Cosmetics:** banners, sigils, animated emblems, title frames, profile backgrounds, tribe forum themes, victory pose frames on leaderboards.
- **Map Pins & Markers:** themed attack/defense markers, rally tokens, and operation arrows.
- **Command Trails:** optional colored trails for outgoing armies visible only to owner/tribe.
- **Seasonal Effects:** village idle animations (bonfires, snow drift), weather overlays (light rain shader), limited-time festival decor.

### Quality-of-Life (QoL) Features (Capped, Non-Power)
- **Queue Extensions:** +1 build queue slot or +1 recruitment queue slot per village, capped globally (e.g., max 2 extra queues). No speed change.
- **Preset/Template Slots:** extra rally point presets, map bookmark folders, intel filters, operation planners.
- **UI Themes:** high-contrast theme, parchment theme, minimal “ops” theme; purely visual.
- **Management Tools:** batch rename villages, bulk troop preset apply, extended report storage, export reports to CSV/JSON.
- **Notification Packs:** customizable alert sounds/visuals; no extra data or timing advantage.

### Limited Time Savers (Strict Caps & Fair Use)
- **Build Speed Tokens:** small % build speed boost (e.g., +10%) for 30 minutes, limited to 2 uses/day/account; disabled on hardcore worlds and during protection.
- **Recruitment Efficiency:** minor population refund on canceled queues (e.g., 50% pop return), purchasable 1–2 times/day; no net troop gain.
- **Travel Planner:** premium UI showing ideal send times across time zones; informational only.
- **Resource Balancer:** instant resource shuffle among owned villages within existing warehouse limits; charges convenience fee but no net gain.

## Forbidden Items (Never Sell)
- Direct troops, unit bundles, or instant army completions.
- Noblemen/envoys/conquest enablers or loyalty/influence reducers.
- Unlimited or large resource packs; any resource pack that exceeds a short catch-up amount.
- Combat buffs (attack/defense %, wall bonuses, morale overrides, extra luck) or vision advantages (scout invulnerability, watchtower radius boosts).
- Speed-ups without strict caps; instant build/recruit completions beyond daily capped tokens.
- Extra command slots or simultaneous attack allowances that change PvP throughput.
- RNG loot boxes with competitive items; any gacha that gates meaningful cosmetics behind undisclosed odds.

## Ethical Design
- **Transparency:** clear pricing in local currency; disclose any odds for randomized cosmetic drops; publish world-specific monetization rules up front.
- **No Dark Patterns:** no bait-and-switch timers, no manipulative FOMO; gentle reminders only. Refund policy easily accessible.
- **Fair Refunds:** grace period refunds on accidental buys; subscription cancellation effective immediately with pro-rate where allowed.
- **Spending Controls:** daily/weekly caps; parental controls; purchase confirmations.
- **Separation of Power:** PvP effectiveness derived solely from play; any monetized time saver remains under strict caps and disabled in competitive finals/hardcore worlds.
- **Data Privacy:** minimal data for payments; no selling of user data.

## Examples (Bundles & Sets)
- **Cosmetic Village Set — “Storm Bastion”:** village skin (storm banners, slate roofs), matching wall texture, command trail (lightning flicker), profile frame, map markers.

- **Season Pass Plus:** Paid track unlock + 1000 Crowns + exclusive season-end skin + extra report storage; no extra power.

## Implementation TODOs
- [ ] World flags: per-world toggle matrix for monetization categories (cosmetics, QoL, time savers) with default “cosmetics-only” on hardcore/finals.
- [ ] Daily caps: enforce per-account daily limits on speed tokens, queue vouchers, refunds; surface remaining quota in store UI and API.
- [ ] Store eligibility: block purchases that break caps or world rules server-side; return clear error codes (`MONETIZATION_DISABLED`, `CAP_REACHED`).
- [ ] Refund/undo: 15-minute grace period for accidental purchases (non-consumed items only); log audit trail with actor/IP/payment ref.
- [ ] Battle pass gating: prevent level skips beyond configured max (e.g., 5 tiers/day); disallow skips near season end if time insufficient.
- [ ] Subscription handling: proration rules and pause/resume states codified; perks auto-expire when sub lapses; perks disabled on monetization-off worlds.
- [ ] Compliance: price display with tax-inclusive option, parental control PIN, spending limit config, and exportable purchase history.
- [ ] Anti-abuse: detect alt-linked accounts funneling cosmetic gifts/time savers; rate-limit gifts and disable for flagged links.
- [ ] UX notes: store badges indicate world-allowed items; tooltips clarify “cosmetic only” and “capped convenience” to avoid P2W perception.
