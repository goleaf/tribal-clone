# Fair-First Strategy Manifesto

## What We Stand For
- **Skill & coordination win.** Time, teamwork, and planning beat spending. No pay-to-win power.
- **Tribe-first.** Shared intel, ops tools, and transparent roles make tribes the core of the experience.
- **Clarity over obscurity.** Reports, timers, and modifiers are exposed; hidden randomness is minimized.
- **Respect for time.** Queues, notifications, and recovery tools reduce pointless grind while preserving stakes.
- **Original, legal-safe world.** Unique unit/building names and mechanics avoid legacy IP overlap; lore is ours.

## What We Avoid
- **Power sales.** No direct stat boosts, loot crates, or premium-only units/buildings.
- **Predatory loops.** No fake scarcity timers or mandatory dailies; breaks are okay.
- **Pushing/abuse.** Anti-push caps, alt detection, fair-trade bounds, and protection systems stay enforced.
- **Opaque outcomes.** Luck/morale/night/terrain modifiers and allegiance changes are shown in reports.

## Player Promises
- **Fair starts and protection.** Beginner protection, morale (where enabled), and anti-bully caps shield new/returning players.
- **Recovery paths.** Hospitals, tribe aid, and catch-up buffs (per world) help rebuild after losses.
- **Transparency.** Reason codes on blocks (ERR_PROTECTED, ERR_TAX, ERR_RATE_LIMIT, etc.), visible cooldowns, and clear tooltips.
- **Opt-in variety.** Worlds advertise modifiers (speed, weather, fog, conquest rules); no surprise rule flips mid-season.

## Tribe & Social Pillars
- Roles/permissions with audit trails; ops planner and shared markers; tribe quests/tech with capped, non-combat bonuses.
- Intel sharing with freshness tags; war/peace states visible on map; sitter/observer roles gated by permissions.

## Economy & Monetization
- Cosmetics-first shop (skins, banners, report frames); QoL boosts capped and available via play.
- Fair-trade bounds and taxes to stop pushing; resource sinks (minting, tribe projects) to stabilize economy.
- Event tokens expire; no permanent advantage from events.

## Combat & Conquest
- Counterplay baked in (fakes, overstack penalties, mantlets vs ranged, pikes vs cav, intel decay).
- Conquest via Standard Bearers/allegiance; no coin nobles; anti-snipe floors and cooldowns to curb ping-pong.
- Reports list modifiers (morale/luck/night/overstack/allegiance changes) with fidelity tied to surviving scouts.

## UX Tone & Language
- Clear, concise, and tribe-positive. Avoid legacy Tribal Wars jargon; use our glossary. No dark patterns or scare copy.

## Living Document
- Reviewed each season and after major feature launches. Linked from in-game Help and marketing pages; versioned in repo.
