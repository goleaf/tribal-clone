# Core Game Vision & Pillars — Persistent Medieval Tribal War Strategy MMO

## Game Overview
- **Fantasy:** Lead a fledgling settlement in a contested medieval frontier, forge a tribe, and wage coordinated wars to control relics, wonders, and lands.
- **Genre:** Persistent, browser-first (mobile web responsive) real-time strategy MMO with tribe-focused PvP, light PvE events, and conquest-driven expansion.
- **Target Audience:** RTS/PvP strategy fans who enjoy timing, planning, and social coordination; ages 16–45; global audience with language/region filters.
- **Platforms:** Browser and mobile web; lightweight client; notifications enabled; optional desktop PWA.
- **Session Length:** Micro (3–5 min check-ins), Short (10–20 min planning), Long (1–2h ops). Designed for asynchronous play with real-time stakes.
- **Competitive Positioning:** Fair-first, no pay-to-win; modern UX; deep social ops; asymmetric world rules; seasonal variants to keep meta fresh.

## Core Fantasy & Emotions
- **Growth & Stewardship:** Feel village expansion from huts to fortresses; pride in efficient builds and thriving economy.
- **Tension & Urgency:** Heartbeat during incoming attacks, tight snipes, and night/day window decisions.
- **Tribal Pride & Belonging:** Identity tied to tribe banner, ops successes, shared stories; camaraderie in war rooms.
- **Cunning & Mastery:** Outsmart foes via intel, fakes, counter-scouts, and perfectly timed trains.
- **Fear & Recovery:** Fear of being scouted/raided; relief and satisfaction rebuilding and striking back.
- **Epic Scale:** Sense of continent-spanning wars, relic sieges, and wonder construction.

## Player Motivations
- **Achievers:**
  - Systems: Rankings (valor, stewardship, intel), achievements, build/tech completion, village count, endgame titles.
  - Features: Detailed stats, hall of fame, cosmetic frames for milestones, speedrun leaderboards (speed worlds).
- **Killers (Competitive PvP):**
  - Systems: War declarations, K/D stats, relic/wonder contests, hardcore worlds, fog-of-war events.
  - Features: Battle logs, war dashboards, raid challenges, minimal protection on hardcore.
- **Socializers:**
  - Systems: Tribes with roles, forums, chat, shared markers, tribe quests, mentor programs.
  - Features: Tribe cosmetics, titles, shared ops planner, social achievements, recruitment tools.
- **Explorers:**
  - Systems: Map exploration, intel mini-game, relic hunts, weather/terrain modifiers, hidden POIs.
  - Features: Discovery achievements, lore snippets on POIs, rotating events with unique mechanics.

## Long-Term Goals
- Build multi-village empire with specialized hubs.
- Lead or be core in a dominant tribe; win wars; capture relics/wonders/beacons.
- Achieve endgame victory; earn legendary titles and cosmetic sets.
- Climb seasonal ladders; collect season points and hall-of-fame entries.
- Complete achievements collections (ops executed, scouts sent, defenses won).
- Amass cosmetic collection: village skins, unit skins, banners, markers, report frames.
- Master niche roles (intel officer, war planner, logistics lead).

## Core Design Pillars
- **Tribe-First Gameplay:**
  - Shared intel, ops planner, tribe quests; roles/permissions; tribe tech (capped); war/peace mechanics.
  - Tribe markers and shared maps encourage coordination.
- **Strategic Clarity:**
  - Transparent reports (morale/luck/loyalty), timers, predictions; clear UI for incoming/outgoing; filters for fakes vs reals.
- **Asymmetric Warfare & Counterplay:**
  - Fakes, decoys, counter-scout, watchtowers, wall/siege interplay, morale variants, night/weather modifiers.
  - No unbeatable tactic; each action has a counter (mantlets vs archers, pikes vs cav, scouts vs fog, etc.).
- **Meaningful Time-Based Decisions:**
  - Travel times, build queues, timed events; send timing; day/night windows; intel decay; stamina in ops.
- **Fair Competitive PvP:**
  - No direct pay-to-win; capped convenience; anti-push/anti-bot systems; morale for protection worlds; hardcore opt-in.
- **Persistence with Recovery:**
  - Losses matter (capture, wall loss) but recovery paths (hospital, tribe aid, shields on beginner). Encourages re-engagement.
- **Variety & Freshness:**
  - Rotating world rules (speed, fog, events), multiple endgame models, experimental worlds, seasonal events and modifiers.

## Player Lifecycle (Phases)
1. **Tutorial (Day 0):** Guided builds, first scout/raid, protection on; goal: understand UI, loop basics; risk: overwhelm → use concise tooltips.
2. **Early Growth (Day 1–2):** Resource fields 5–7, Wall 1–2, first Barracks units; goal: secure economy; risk: idle queues.
3. **First Scouting & PvE (Day 2–4):** Scouts barb/POI; first raids; learns reports; goal: taste combat; risk: over-aggro, losing troops → provide recoveries.
4. **Join Tribe (Day 3–5):** Auto-suggest tribes; chats; tribe quests unlocked; goal: social hook; risk: tribe mismatch → filters.
5. **First PvP Skirmish (Week 1):** Small raids, defense call; goal: understand support/fakes; risk: discouragement → protection vs bullies, morale.
6. **Expansion Path (Week 2):** Build Academy/Hall of Banners; mint standards; first conquest; goal: second village; risk: stalled minting → tribe aid.
7. **Specialization (Weeks 2–3):** Offense/defense/scout/support villages; ops planner use; goal: role identity; risk: resource strain → trade tools.
8. **War Stage (Week 3–6):** Coordinated ops, multiple fronts; goal: hold/expand territory, relic grabs; risk: burnout → event pacing, rest windows.
9. **Endgame Push (Late):** Wonder/Beacon/Relic control or dominance; goal: win condition; risk: stalemate → decay/siege windows.
10. **Post-Victory/Season End:** Rewards, hall-of-fame, cosmetics; optional museum mode; goal: retention to next world; risk: churn → transfer titles, social carryover.

## Game Tone & Aesthetic Direction
- **Visual:** Gritty-but-readable medieval frontier; timber, stone, canvas; no high fantasy. Clean UI overlays with parchment accents; color-coded diplomacy.
- **UI Tone:** Informative, restrained; alerts clear but not spammy; tooltips concise; operations map feels tactical.
- **Audio:** Subtle ambient (wind, smithy), escalating cues for attacks; percussion for war; muted at night bonus hours.
- **Cultural Inspirations:** Pan-European medieval frontier; avoid specific real-world heraldry; create original tribes, banners, lore snippets for POIs.

## Innovation vs. Tradition
- **Familiar (Tradition):** Grid map, resource fields, build queues, walls vs rams, noble-like conquest, tribes/alliances, morale/luck options, night bonus.
- **Original Twists:**
  - Standard Bearer conquest unit with Hall of Banners; allegiance/influence variations.
  - Intel depth: false reports, intel decay, watchtower radius, info-reveal objectives.
  - Beacon network/wonder variants; rotating endgame models; migratory relics.
  - Weather/fog events impacting scouting and movement; terrain/roads speeds.
  - Tribe ops planner with assignments and audit logs; shared intel overlays with freshness indicators.
  - Capped convenience monetization; cosmetic-first economy with fair constraints.
  - Hospital/wounded recovery and occupation tax to shape attrition.
  - Role-based permissions and spy/observer ranks to manage leaks.

## Appendix – Extra Ideas (Stretch)
- **Kingmaking Events:** Late-game elections where majority allegiance picks a “High Council,” providing cosmetic crowns.
- **Dynamic Frontlines:** Captureable supply lines that affect movement speed for allied commands.
- **Seasonal Weather Tracks:** Players influence weather fronts via POIs, altering vision/speed.
- **Campaign Chapters:** Time-limited narrative arcs with branching tribe choices; cosmetic rewards.
- **Spectator Tools:** Post-season replay of major wars; “war stories” auto-generated for tribe profiles.
- **Mini-Puzzles:** Timing sims/tutorials embedded for practice (sniping, noble trains) with no resource cost.
- **Settlement Founding (optional world):** Allow founding new villages (costly) to complement conquest.
- **Asymmetric Tribe Perks (experimental):** Draftable tribe edicts each week with temporary, small modifiers.

## Implementation TODOs
- [ ] Pillar alignment audit: map systems (combat, conquest, tribes, economy, map) to pillars (tribe-first, clarity, counterplay, fairness, recovery, variety) and flag gaps.
- [ ] Lexicon pass: replace legacy tribal-war terms with unique naming across UI/tutorials/marketing; maintain a glossary.
  - Progress: IP-safe glossary created (docs/ip-glossary.md) and unit/building renames underway.
- [x] World presets: documented archetype defaults (casual/classic/hardcore/experimental/seasonal) in `docs/world-presets.md`.
- [ ] Vision KPIs: track fairness (protection/rate-limit hits), social engagement (ops, chat), progression pacing (time to 2nd village), and spend-parity metrics.
- [ ] Player-facing manifesto: in-game/help page with vision/pillars and anti-P2W stance; keep in sync with marketing copy.
- [ ] Differentiation proof: document unique mechanics (influence-based conquest, weather fronts, beacon networks, intel decay/misdirection) with comparisons to legacy games to support IP defensibility.
- [ ] UX tone guide: codify voice/tone for tooltips/warnings/reports aligned with pillars (clear, fair, tribe-first) and ban legacy jargon; share with localization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pillar audit completed with documented gaps and owners; tracked to closure.
- Lexicon/glossary updated and applied across UI/tutorials/marketing; no legacy tribal-war terms remain in shipped strings.
- World preset docs published with defaults and rationale; used in world creation flows.
- Vision KPIs wired to telemetry/dashboard with weekly review; alerts on fairness/social/pacing regressions.
- Manifesto page live in help/marketing; updated when vision changes; clearly states anti-P2W stance.
- Differentiation proof doc published comparing unique mechanics vs legacy games; legal/IP review signed off.
- UX tone guide adopted in string linting/localization; audits show removal of legacy jargon in tooltips/reports/tutorials.

## Open Questions
- Which legacy terms are still risky for IP overlap and need renaming first? (list candidates and owners)
- How frequently should the vision/pillar audit be revisited (per season, per major release)?
- Do archetype presets need hard enforcement or are they templates with warnings on divergence?
