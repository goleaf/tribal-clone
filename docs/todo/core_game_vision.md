# Core Game Vision Document
## Medieval Tribal War Strategy MMO

---

## 1. Game Overview

### High-Level Fantasy
Players step into the role of a village chieftain in a harsh, medieval-inspired world where survival depends on cunning, cooperation, and conquest. Starting with a single settlement in a vast, persistent world, players must gather resources, construct buildings, research technologies, train armies, and forge alliances with other chieftains to form powerful tribes. The ultimate goal is to dominate territories, crush rival tribes, and etch your name into the annals of history as a legendary warlord.
