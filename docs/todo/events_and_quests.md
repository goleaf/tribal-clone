# Events, Quests, and Daily Systems — Persistent PvP Medieval Tribal War Browser MMO

## Design Principles
- Support PvP-first gameplay: events/quests nudge into the core loop (resource growth, scouting, raids, coordinated ops) without replacing it.
- Respect time: limited daily tasks, optional streak bonuses with make-up days, no mandatory log-ins for power.
- Fairness: rewards avoid direct pay-to-win; boosts are capped, cosmetic-forward, and mostly time-bound conveniences.
- Variety and rotation: mix of economy, combat, intel, tribe-coop, and exploration tasks to prevent rote grinding.
- Clarity: UI shows requirements, timers, progress, and next reset; mobile-friendly and low-click.

## Daily Systems
- **Daily Tasks Framework:** 4–6 tasks per day; complete any 3 for the daily chest. Auto-reroll 1 task/day; manual reroll with cooldown.
- **Login Bonus (Fair):** Optional soft streak (e.g., 5-day cycle) with make-up tokens; rewards are modest resources, event tokens, cosmetics, queue vouchers (not troops). No stacking beyond one cycle.
- **Rotating Objectives:** Pull from varied buckets to avoid grind; difficulty scales with player power and world age.
- **Anti-Grind Measures:** Low task counts, catch-up tokens, no “spend premium” objectives, and alternative completions (combat vs economy variants).

### Daily Task Ideas
- Collect X of each resource from production (scaled by village tier).
- Upgrade any building by 1 level.
- Train Y population worth of troops.
- Send at least 3 scouting missions; return 1 valid report.
- Win or draw 1 defensive battle.
- Plunder at least Z resources from barb/POI.
- Send support to a tribe member that lands (even if no battle occurs).
- Complete 1 trade shipment or accept 1 market offer.
- Place 2 map markers for an operation.
- Contribute to tribe quest progress (any category).
- Claim an event milestone.

## Weekly & Seasonal Systems
- **Weekly Challenges:** 5–7 objectives with higher thresholds; complete any 4 for a weekly chest. Examples: win 5 battles vs enemies of similar score; deliver 50k total resources via trade; train 500 population of troops; capture 1 village or relic.
- **Tribe-Wide Goals:** Collective targets reset weekly; reward tribe cosmetics, intel tools, or small queue vouchers shared to contributors. Examples: repel 10 attacks on allies; donate 200k resources to the tribe aid pool; perform 15 successful scouts on war targets.
- **Seasonal Ladders:** Fixed-duration season (60–90 days) tracking Valor (combat), Stewardship (economy), Recon (intel), and Allegiance (control). Placement grants cosmetics, titles, currency; no stat bonuses.
- **Rotating Modifiers:** Weekly world buffs/debuffs (e.g., “Swift Scouts” +10% scout speed; “Thrifty Builders” -5% build cost; “Foggy Nights” reduced vision). Previewed in advance; never stack to overpower combat.

## Quest Types & Examples
### Story Quests (Narrative Arcs)
- **Arc: Rise of the Shire**
  - Build Town Hall to level 3; reward: resources + village banner.
  - Train first 50 Spears; reward: scout token.
  - Scout neighboring sector; reward: map marker set.
  - Win first offensive battle; reward: small build speed token.
  - Join a tribe; reward: profile frame.

### Tutorial Quests (Guided NPE)
- Construct Rally Point; send a scout to a barb; upgrade Storage; enable notifications; join tribe; set first preset. Rewards: small resource bundles, instant 5-minute build skips (one-time), cosmetics.

### Repeatable Quests (Daily/Weekly)
- Raid barb villages 3 times; reward: tokens.
- Deliver 10k resources via market; reward: reroll token.
- Support allies for cumulative 2 hours; reward: cosmetic marker.
- Destroy 1 wall level in an enemy village; reward: time-limited banner.

### Tribe Quests (Collective)
- As a tribe, gather 500k resources in aid; reward: tribe emblem upgrade.
- Win 20 defensive battles for members; reward: shared queue voucher to contributors.
- Capture 2 relic shrines; reward: tribe forum theme.

### World Quests (Server-Wide)
- All players: defeat 50k invading raiders during an event window; community progress bar unlocks global cosmetic for the world.
- Province contest: first tribe to place 5 active beacons on province nodes; reward: prestige points and map flare.

## Event Types (Limited-Time)
- **Harvest Festival (Resource Boom):** 5–7 days. Increased resource production by 10%; roaming harvest caravans on map drop tokens. Mini-games: donate sets of resources for cosmetic harvest skins. Balanced by plunder protection to avoid imbalance.
- **Raider Incursion:** NPC warbands spawn on borders; players scout and attack them for loot and reports. If ignored, raiders hit nearest villages with moderate strength. Community goal to clear waves unlocks banner.
- **Relic Hunt:** Relic fragments spawn as POIs; capture and hold to assemble relics. Holding grants victory points; fragments migrate every 12 hours. Encourages scouting and mobile ops.
- **Siege Trials:** Time-limited challenges focusing on wall/siege interplay: weekly leaderboard for wall levels destroyed, with rewards capped to cosmetics and tokens. Optional PvE siege camps to practice.
- **Trade Winds:** Market tax reduced; caravans move faster; random shortage/surplus rotations (e.g., Clay scarce, Wood abundant). Encourages trade routes; capped to avoid resource inflation.
- **Winter Blight:** Weather modifier reduces cavalry speed and boosts wall effectiveness; daily quests revolve around heating supplies (resource donations) and defending during storms.
- **Beacon Rally (Tribe Ops Event):** Tribes place temporary beacons; synchronized captures of beacon clusters grant tribe cosmetics and intel range buffs (cosmetic/vision only, not combat stats).
- **Caravan Carnival:** Escort NPC caravans across map lanes; success grants tokens; PvP enabled along routes. Anti-grief timers prevent repeated sniping by same attacker.

## Rewards (Fair, Non-P2W)
- **Resources:** Modest bundles scaled to player power and capped per day; no giant stockpiles.
- **Boosts (Capped):** Small build speed tokens (+10% for 30m, 2/day), scout speed tokens, research queue vouchers. Disabled on hardcore worlds if needed.
- **Cosmetics:** Village skins, unit skins, banners, map markers, profile frames, tribe forum themes.
- **Currencies:** Event tokens, soft medals, limited premium currency stipends within daily/season caps.
- **Utility:** Extra preset slots, report storage, reroll tokens for quests; all capped and earnable via play.
- **No Direct Power:** No troop bundles, no attack/defense buffs, no loyalty modifiers, no morale overrides.

## Integration with Core Loop
- Events push players to use core verbs: scout, attack, support, trade, build. Rewards reinforce existing loops (queues, presets) rather than bypassing them.
- Objectives scale with world age and player tier; PvP actions count more than pure PvE to avoid farming-only progression.
- Tribe-focused goals encourage coordination without forcing mega-alliances; contributions tracked individually to avoid free-riding.
- Protection rules remain active (no events that bypass shields or night bonus). Resource rewards never exceed storage caps.

## Event Timelines (Examples)

  - Day 7: Cleanup period; reward claims and exchange shop open; no new attacks.

- **5-Day Trade Winds Timeline**

  - Day 2: Caravans gain +10% speed; rotating shortage switches to Iron.
  - Day 3: Surprise flash contract: fulfill 3 large trades within 12h for a cosmetic map marker.
  - Day 4: Market tax returns to normal; caravans still faster; quests push balanced resource sharing.
  - Day 5: Closing auctions; event token shop discounts; recap and rewards distributed.

  - Day 2: Leaderboard for wall damage dealt in PvP battles (normalized by attacker/defender score).
  - Day 3: Final challenge camp with rotating wall buffs; cosmetic siege crew skin for top contributors (no stat bonus).

## Rotations & Cadence
- Daily tasks reset at server midnight; weekly challenges reset on fixed weekday with 12h warning.
- Major events run 3–7 days with at least 3 days between; minor modifiers rotate weekly.
- Seasonal ladders align with world season duration; end with summary and cosmetic/title distribution.

## Anti-Exploitation Considerations
- Caps on event resource rewards tied to storage; diminishing returns on repeat farming of PvE camps.
- Contribution-based tribe rewards to prevent freeloading; minimum participation thresholds.
- Anti-push flags on trades/resource donations during events; taxed if sender power >> receiver outside tribe.
- PvE rewards nerfed after X clears/day to prevent bot-friendly farming.
