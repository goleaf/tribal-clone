# World Presets (Default Knobs)

Baseline knobs for common world archetypes, aligned to the core vision (fair-first, tribe-focused, no pay-to-win). Values are starting points; adjust per season/event.

## Notes
- All presets keep monetization cosmetic/QoL only.
- Envoy (conquest) uses influence/control model; coin minting disabled in all presets.
- Adjust tribe caps, barb density, and event cadence to match player population per season.
- Experimental worlds may toggle niche rules (fog, asymmetric tribe edicts, weather fronts). Ensure rules are surfaced in world creation and in-game help.
