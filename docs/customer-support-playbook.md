# Customer Support Playbook — TODOs

## Goals
- Provide consistent, fast responses to player issues (account, payments, gameplay fairness).
- Reduce escalation load through clear policies, macros, and tooling.

## Tasks
- Ticket categorization: auth/account, payments, exploits/cheating, harassment, technical issues, gameplay questions, refund requests.
- SLAs: set response/resolution targets per severity; auto-acknowledge receipts; escalation paths defined.
- Macros/templates: for common cases (password reset help, payment verification, fair-play policy, refund policy, protection rules, appeal flow).
- Tooling access: support view of player history (bans, purchases, flags), rollback utilities (within policy), and refund triggers with audit.
- Verification: steps for ownership verification before sensitive actions; logging of all actions with actor/time.
- Abuse/harassment handling: standard responses, mute/ban policies, evidence requirements, escalation to moderation.
- Appeal flow: structured form for bans/flags; timelines and evidence required; response templates.
- Metrics: ticket volume, response/resolution times, CSAT, reopen rate, macro usage; weekly review.
- Training: onboarding for new agents, playbook updates, and shadowing sessions; change log for policy updates.
