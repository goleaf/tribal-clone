# Combat balance notes

- Random variance shrunk to +/-7% per side; results are less swingy while still unpredictable.
- Morale now depends on village points (falling back to population): bigger attackers can be penalized down to 0.7x, smaller attackers can be boosted up to 1.5x.
- Wall defense uses an effective wall level that can be suppressed by incoming rams before casualties are applied; raids suppress less wall strength and never apply permanent damage.
- Winners always lose at least 5% of their army (about 3% on raids) scaled by the power ratio, reducing zero-loss stomps.
- Raids cap loot at 60% of stored resources and never damage walls or buildings; full attacks behave as before but with the new casualty curve and morale.
